# Chip-8
A CHIP8 emulator

Accurately emulates all opcodes and computer architecture of the CHIP8 virtual machine. Written using C++ and SFML for the Mac OSX operating system. Commented and explained as much as possible for the learning purposes of others. Feel free to steal the code and do whatever you want with it :)
